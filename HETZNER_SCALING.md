- 1 Gbps = 125 MB/sec theoretical max
```

## Capacity Analysis for Union WebSocket Backend

### Realistic Load (5k Concurrent Peak)
```
Memory Usage:
- 5k connections Ã— 1.2MB = 6GB
- Server overhead = 2GB
- Total needed = 8GB
- Available = 128GB
- Headroom = 16x capacity!

CPU Usage:
- Current: 32 broadcast workers
- Ryzen 9 7950X3D: 32 threads
- Perfect match for current architecture
- Single-thread performance excellent for WebSocket I/O

Network Usage:
- 5k clients Ã— 12KB/sec = 60MB/sec
- Available = 125MB/sec (1 Gbps)
- Utilization = 48% at peak
- Plenty of headroom
```

### Theoretical Maximum Capacity
```
Memory Limit:
- 128GB Ã· 1.2MB per client = ~106k concurrent connections
- Far exceeds any realistic need

Network Limit:
- 125MB/sec Ã· 12KB per client = ~10k concurrent connections
- Network becomes bottleneck before memory

CPU Limit:
- 32 threads perfectly match 32 broadcast workers
- Zen 4 + 3D V-Cache excellent for this workload
- Estimate: 15k-20k concurrent connections
```

## Cost Comparison

### Hetzner vs Cloud Providers

#### Single Server Comparison
```
Hetzner Dedicated:
- CPU: 16c/32t Ryzen 9 7950X3D
- RAM: 128GB ECC DDR5
- Storage: 3.84TB NVMe
- Network: 1 Gbps unlimited
- Cost: $100/month

AWS Equivalent (c6i.8xlarge):
- CPU: 16c/32t Intel Xeon
- RAM: 64GB (need c6i.12xlarge for 96GB)
- Storage: EBS additional cost
- Network: 12.5 Gbps (but charged per GB)
- Cost: ~$1,200/month + bandwidth

Azure Equivalent (D16s v5):
- Similar specs to AWS
- Cost: ~$1,100/month + bandwidth

Cost Savings: 10-12x cheaper than cloud!
```

#### Bandwidth Cost Comparison
```
Hetzner:
- 1 Gbps unlimited = FREE
- Daily capacity: 125MB/s Ã— 86400s = 10.8TB/day
- Your usage: 5TB/day (well within limits)
- Overage: â‚¬1/TB (if you exceed 20TB/month on 10G)

AWS:
- Data transfer out: $0.09/GB = $90/TB
- Your 5TB/day = 150TB/month
- Cost: 150TB Ã— $90 = $13,500/month just for bandwidth!

Bandwidth savings: 100x+ cheaper!
```

## Optimized Configuration for Hetzner

### Perfect Match Architecture
```go
const (
    maxWorkers         = 32    // Matches 32 threads perfectly
    broadcastBuffer    = 5000  // Balanced for memory efficiency
    clientShards       = 32    // Align with CPU threads
    maxMessageQueue    = 1000  // Plenty of RAM available
)
```

### Performance Optimizations
```go
// Take advantage of massive RAM
const (
    // Increase stats retention
    statsRetentionDays = 90    // vs 30 days default
    
    // Larger snapshot buffers
    snapshotBufferSize = 100000 // vs 10000 default
    
    // More aggressive caching
    transferCacheSize = 1000000 // 1M transfers in memory
)
```

## Scaling Strategy with Hetzner

### Phase 1: Single Server (0-10k concurrent)
```
Current Hetzner server handles this easily
Cost: $100/month
Capacity: 10k+ concurrent connections
```

### Phase 2: Load Balancing (10k-30k concurrent)
```
Add second Hetzner server: $100/month
Simple HAProxy load balancer
Total cost: $200/month
Capacity: 20k+ concurrent connections
```

### Phase 3: Multi-Region (30k+ concurrent)
```
Add servers in different Hetzner locations:
- Germany (primary): $100/month
- US (secondary): $100/month  
- Asia (tertiary): $100/month
Total cost: $300/month
Global capacity: 30k+ concurrent
```

## Real-World Performance Estimates

### Conservative Estimates (Hetzner Server)
```
Concurrent Connections: 15,000
Daily Sessions: 360,000 (24x current)
Memory Usage: 18GB (14% of available)
CPU Usage: 60% (comfortable headroom)
Network Usage: 180MB/sec (144% of 1 Gbps)
```

### Network Bottleneck Analysis
```
1 Gbps = 125 MB/sec
At 12KB per client: 125MB Ã· 12KB = ~10,400 clients
Network becomes limiting factor around 10k concurrent

Solution: Add second server for $100/month
Combined capacity: 20k+ concurrent
```

## Total Cost of Ownership

### Monthly Costs (Realistic 5k Peak)
```
Hetzner Server: $100
Monitoring (self-hosted): $0
Backup storage: $10
Domain/DNS: $5
Total: $115/month

vs Cloud equivalent: $1,400/month
Savings: 92% cost reduction!
```

### Growth Costs
```
10k concurrent: $100/month (single server)
20k concurrent: $200/month (two servers)
50k concurrent: $500/month (five servers)

vs AWS equivalent for 50k: $25,000+/month
```

## Conclusion

### Hetzner Advantages
1. **Incredible value**: 10-12x cheaper than cloud
2. **Perfect specs**: Ryzen 9 7950X3D ideal for WebSocket workload
3. **Massive headroom**: 128GB RAM vs 8GB needed
4. **Unlimited bandwidth**: No surprise bills
5. **Simple scaling**: Add servers as needed

### Recommendations
1. **Start with single Hetzner server** - handles 10x your current peak
2. **Optimize for the hardware** - use all 32 threads
3. **Monitor network usage** - 1 Gbps is the only real limit
4. **Plan horizontal scaling** - add servers at 8k+ concurrent

### Bottom Line
**Your $100/month Hetzner server can handle 10k+ concurrent connections** - that's 2x your realistic peak load with massive room for growth. The cost savings vs cloud providers are absolutely insane! ðŸš€

This is probably the most cost-effective WebSocket hosting solution possible.
